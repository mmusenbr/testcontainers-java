# Fixing Issues with Discovering A Supported Container Runtime Environment

If you ended up on this page, 
it seems that either Testcontainers was not able to find a supported container runtime in your environment,
or you found page while browsing the documentation in search of information on dealing with errors regarding Testcontainers' environment discovery mechanism.

Testcontainers requires a supported container runtime environment to be present in order to function.
Here is a list of supported container runtime environments, that can get you up to speed quickly:

* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
* [Docker Engine on Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
* [Testcontainers Cloud](https://www.testcontainers.cloud)

For more extensive information on supported container runtime environments, and how to configure container runtime environments that are not supported by default,
please refer to [this page](https://www.testcontainers.org/supported_docker_environment/) in our documentation.
